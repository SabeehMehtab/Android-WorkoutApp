# Android-WorkoutApp
This is a 7 minute workout app, comprising of 12 different excercises. It is designed to keep the user engaged using voice commands and time constraints on each excercise. The app keeps a track record of every workout completed in the history section. It can also calculate the BMI of a person in two possible ways, metric or US units. 

## Testing mode
This is a mode responsible for debugging and testing the workout execution after the start button is clicked, to make sure everything carries on smoothly till all the excercises are exhausted and the workout completion page is reached.
